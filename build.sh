# Build the actlize (PPU cutlass3) W4A16 gs=128 comparison bench.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE MARLIN Makefile. actlize does not build with the bare `nvcc` (no -arch) that the
# marlin kernels use. Its toolchain is the PPU SDK: hgcc as the device compiler (-arch=ppu_10), g++ as host,
# linking libhggc_wrapper / libhggcrt1 / libhggc, with -DSWITCH_TO_HGGCRT -DCUTLASS_USE_PACKED_TUPLE=1. All of
# that is set up by third_party/actlize/cmake/PPUToolchain.cmake, so we drive actlize's own cmake.
#
# WHY THE OVERLAY. actlize's examples are an explicit foreach() list in examples/CMakeLists.txt that
# add_subdirectory's each one; there is no out-of-tree example hook. The least-invasive way to build our .cu
# through the *proven* example machinery is to drop it in as a new example dir and append it to that list.
# We do it as untracked files + a restorable one-line edit, so the submodule's tracked content is unchanged
# (the script restores examples/CMakeLists.txt at the end).
#
# Prereq: PPU_SDK=<path with bin/hgcc> (or PPU_HOME). ppu001 == ppu0010 == ACOMPUTE 10000.
