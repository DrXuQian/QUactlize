# Every PROJECT-LOCAL cmake helper called in CMakeLists.txt must be defined in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Three target registrations were written against `cutlass_w4a16_example`, a name that does
# not exist -- the real helper is `ppu_w4a16_executable`. Nothing local catches that: it is not a C++ error, the
# syntax check never reads CMakeLists.txt, and cmake only complains at CONFIGURE time, which on this project
# means a full pull-and-build on the box before the mistake is visible. The name was written down from memory
# instead of read off the file, which is this codebase's most expensive recurring failure.
#
# The check is deliberately narrow: only calls whose name looks like a project helper (contains w4a16, ppu_,
# example or executable) are required to be defined here. Builtins and cutlass's own helpers are out of scope,
# because an allowlist of those would go stale and start hiding real errors.
