// L97 -- DOES A THREAD BEYOND THE COPY'S THREAD LAYOUT WRITE OUTSIDE ITS TILE? The last unexamined write into
// smem_scale_raw, and the only known undefined behaviour left on the packed path.
//
// GmemTiledCopyScalePacked is make_tiled_copy(atom, Layout<Shape<Int<Scale_TileN>,_1>>, Layout<Shape<_1,_16>>), i.e.
// Scale_TileN = 128 threads. Its get_slice(thread_idx) is called by ALL size(TiledMma) = 256 threads of the CTA. If
// cute does not wrap the index, threads 128..255 partition at n = 128..255 of a tile whose N extent is 128 -- and
// SmemLayoutScaleRawStaged's stride is (16, 1, Scale_TileN*16), so n = 128 is EXACTLY the first byte of the next
// stage. With Stages = 2 that means half the CTA scribbles over the stage the other half is about to read.
//
// This is worth its own file because rowC's failure is intermittent: it was bad=128, then bad=724, then MATCH with no
// semantic source change (the =&r fix was refuted by rebuilding with "=r" and passing). A latent out-of-range write
// whose damage depends on scheduling behaves exactly like that.
