"""Box-built sources must not name NVIDIA-only identifiers in code the box actually compiles.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PLAIN GREP. syntax_check.sh reported 0 noise lines for these very files
and the box then failed on `fatal error: cuda_fp16.h: No such file or directory`. It could not have caught it:
local nvcc HAS cuda_fp16.h whether or not -D__HGGCCC__ is passed, so a wrong-platform INCLUDE parses fine and
only the box disagrees. The same blind spot covers cudaStream_t in a signature and __halves2half2, an
intrinsic that exists in CUDA and appears NOWHERE in actlize.

A plain grep is not enough either, because the portable spelling is itself written as
    #if defined(__HGGCCC__) ... #else <the CUDA one> #endif
so the CUDA name is PRESENT in every correctly-ported file. The check therefore evaluates the same conditions
the box does -- __HGGCCC__ defined, ENABLE_BF16 not -- and only reports hits in the live branches. That makes
it exact rather than heuristic, and it is the difference between a check that is trusted and one that gets a
growing exception list until it hides the next real hit.

Identifiers that exist in CUDA *and* in actlize are deliberately NOT on the list: half2, __hfma2, __hsub2,
__hadd2, __hmul2, __half2half2, __shfl_xor_sync, __syncthreads, uint4, uint2, dim3, float2, __float2half and
__half2float were all confirmed present in the actlize include tree, so they are portable.
