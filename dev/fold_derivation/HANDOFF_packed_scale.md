# HANDOFF — the GGUF-native scale/zero channel (plan #20)

Written at the end of the session that built it. Everything below is either **measured** (and says where) or **derived and
gated** (and says by which probe). Where something is an assumption, it says so.

---

## 1. What this was for

Feed the mixed-input grouped GEMM the scale/zero **in the form the gguf actually stores** — 6-bit codes plus one fp16 `d`
(and `dmin`) per 256-element superblock — instead of two fp16 planes that the offline pre-multiplies. Two motivations:

* **the ask**: the device should hold the gguf's bytes, not a widened copy (device memory is the scarce thing);
* **the hoped-for win**: gmem traffic halved, the zero channel's smem gone, and the bank conflicts gone.

## 2. What is DONE and verified on hardware (ppu001)

| thing | evidence |
|---|---|
| **Q3_K / Q6_K drop the zero channel entirely** | `test_q3_bconcat_real` rungs 6–7 MATCH incl. `last rung vs native Q3_K golden bad=0/32768`; `test_q65_bconcat_real` two Q6 `ScaleOnly bias 32` rows + one Q5 `bias 16` row MATCH, `0 failing configuration(s)` |
| **the gguf's native scale/zero runs end to end** | `test_q4k_packed_gemm` rowA/rowB/**rowC** all MATCH with `PPU_PACKED_SCALE=1`, on real `blk.11.ffn_down.weight` |
| **the single-plane int4 AFFINE path is correct** | `test_q4k_packed_gemm` rowB — the FIRST external-golden check of it; everything validated before was ScaleOnly (`bench_cutlass_w4a16::xcheck_grouped` passes `zeros=nullptr`) |
| **the bit maps** | `l91` over 4096 real superblocks × 8 groups vs `get_scale_min_k4`, 0 bad |
| **the decode's arithmetic** | `l93`: 32768 real Q4_K groups, `(scale,zero)` **bit-identical** to the host's fp32-then-round |
| **the converter bias mechanism** | `l92`: `x*mul + add == c − Bias` over the full concatenated range for Q3 (W=3, bias 4), Q6 (W=6, 32), Q5 (W=5, 16), 0 bad; defaults unchanged |
| **the offline** | `dump_packed_scale.py` 4 gates green on real weights, incl. `f16(f32(d)*f32(sc)) == f16(d)*f16(sc)` bit-for-bit over 136192 groups |

## 3. What is DONE and NOT paying off

Same-config A/B, decode band `L=64 top-k=8 N=K=2048 gs=32`, `SK_QUANT=2` (ScaleZero), winner `16x128:256 w16x16 s2 S=1`:

| build | winner |
|---|---|
| baseline (fp16 planes) | **20.12 / 20.22 / 20.36 us** (three runs; same-config spread is ~13%) |
| **E** — decode per lane in registers | 26.89 (and TK=256 fell off the board) |
| **F** — decode in a synchronous loader, into the fp16 planes | 24.17 (TK=256 back on top → inner loop is clean) |
| **F′** — cp.async raw bytes to staging, decode at the existing barrier | 25.00 / 24.79 |

**The pinned A/B settled it (kernel #233, `(8,16,1)x(256,1,1)` on both sides, `v.mma` 131,072 / `v.lop3.i` 546,816 /
`v.bfi.i` 270,336 / `tsm.ld.swzl` 168,960 / `smem.ld` 31,744 / `vmem.acp.commit.grp` 19,456 all identical -- the B
channel and the mma are untouched):**

| | base | packed |
|---|---|---|
| time | **20.11 us** | **22.70 us** (+12.9%) |
| cycles | 34,191 | 38,588 |
| registers | 102 | **98** -- LOWER, so no spill |

The winner-row numbers above (24.17 / 25.00) mixed shapes; **+12.9% is the real cost**. Where it goes, all six added
ALU opcodes landing on the same count:

| term | delta instructions | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| convert ALU (`v.mul.f16`, `v.add.f16`, `v.shrl.i`, `v.or.i`, `v.and.i` ... each ~**+73,728**) | ~440K | **exactly one instruction per (column, group, field)** -- 73,728 = 4 warps x 16 x 9 passes x 128 CTAs, where 16 = 8 groups x 2 fields. Already the per-value floor. |
| `tsm.st` (shared store) | +71,680 | improvable: 2 B per lane uses 16 of 32 banks, so 1.83 transactions per instruction and +73,728 conflicts |
| `Shared Load` | +4,608 | **optimal** -- the four `uint32` reads vectorised into ONE 16 B `smem.ld` per lane per pass |
| `Shared Store From Global Load` (cp.async) | **-9,216 (-38%)** | the traffic win, and it does show up |
| scalar bookkeeping | ~150K | the loop and its `s.lop.emsk` |

`Shared Load` bank conflicts moved **+0.00%**: the read side is byte-identical, as designed.

**No redundancy left to remove.** The problem needs `8 experts x 2048 cols x 64 groups = 1,048,576` (column, group)
pairs decoded; the kernel decodes `128 CTAs x 128 cols x 8 groups x 9 passes = 1,179,648`. Ratio **1.125** -- the 9
passes for 8 k-tiles at Stages=2, nothing more.

**Two micro-optimisations, with honest sizes.** (a) one thread per **two** adjacent columns storing `half2`: halves the
store instructions, fills all 32 banks, conflicts to zero -- ~36K instructions, **~0.6%**. (b) pack `(sc, mn)` into one
half2, `| 0x64006400`, one `hfma2` with multiplier `(d, dmin)` and addend `(-1152d, -1152dmin)` hoisted per column: 12
instructions per pair down to ~8 -- ~150K, **~4%**. This is TODO #18. Both together take +12.9% to roughly +8%.

**It cannot reach zero**, and that is the conclusion rather than a limitation: 1.05M pairs must be decoded, each costs
~12 instructions, and the whole kernel is only 4.4M instructions. A 16% instruction increase does not buy a 0% time
increase. So the in-GEMM decode is a **12.9% tax on every forward pass**, where the load-time conversion kernel of
section 10 pays it **once**. Unless the 11% of weight bytes is worth more than 12.9% of decode-band GEMM time, the
separate kernel is strictly better.

**Two hypotheses this refuted along the way.** F′ restored async and got *worse*, so the exposed load latency was
never the main term. What F and F′ share is the decode: per CTA per k-tile, 512 decodes (~11 instructions each) **and 1024
`STS.16`** — where the fp16 path has cp.async write the same two tiles with **zero instructions**. With acu showing LSU at
6% busy and IALU/FALU at 14%, trading a free async copy for explicit stores plus ALU is the wrong direction in this band.

**Recommendation: stop pushing this in the decode band.** Keep it macro-gated and OFF; the wins it does have (gmem halved,
one stream, the zero tile removable, no offline pre-multiplication, bank conflicts gone) only become visible where **smem
capacity or occupancy** is the binding constraint — prefill/dense with large tiles, or configs where the scale+zero tiles
cost a block per CU. That is where to measure next.

## 4. Ruled out — do not retry these

Each of these cost real time; the reason matters more than the verdict.

1. **The 16 B unit as one `uint128_t` element.** Would have kept the gmem tensor scalar and every residue line unchanged.
   cute rejects it: `Copy_Atom<PPU_CP_ASYNC_CACHEGLOBAL<uint128_t>, uint128_t>` with a `(_1,_1)` value layout fails
   `copy_traits.hpp`'s *"dst failed to vectorize into registers"*. The element must be `uint8_t` with `(_1,_16)`.
2. **Decoding all groups into a fragment-shaped register array** (once per k-tile, no state passed around): ~**+64
   registers** per lane on top of ~140. Refused for prefill's sake.
3. **Interleaving `(scale, zero)` in N so one read gets both.** `tCrS` is `make_fragment_like(partition_fragment_B(...))`,
   so each slot is bound to a specific `n` of the mma B operand; interleaving gives a lane 4 scales and 4 zeros of
   *different* n.
4. **Read-side (per-lane) decode — E.** Per lane per k-tile it needs 2 columns × 8 groups = 16 `(scale,zero)` pairs at ~11
   instructions each (Q4_K is affine: two fields, two conversions, two products, one ZMul fma) → ~1.4M extra ALU to save
   ~0.27M shared loads. And the same `(column, group)` is decoded by all 4 lanes sharing that column (`l94 (7)`), which no
   tuning removes.
5. **"The exposed LDG is the remaining cost."** Refuted by F′ (see §3).
6. **A template-parameter gate around a generic lambda** (`packed_or_empty<On>([&](auto){...})`) to keep an off unit from
   instantiating a body: EDG instantiates the lambda body anyway, so empty stand-ins reach `partition_S`.
7. **`if constexpr (kPackedScaleOn)` as a discard mechanism.** `kPackedScaleOn` is a *class constant*, not
   value-dependent, so **both branches are instantiated**. Only a condition that depends on a template parameter of the
   enclosing function discards. This one bit twice.

## 5. Current code state

* actlize branch `ppu-w4a16-dev`, Kernels branch `ppu_dev`; the Kernels gitlink must be bumped with every actlize change
  (the box builds from committed state — one bump was missed this session and produced a "my change did nothing" round).
* `PPU_PACKED_SCALE=1` turns the channel on. **Default off ⇒ byte-identical**: the staging engine is last in
  `SharedStorage` and sized 0, and the read side (s2r, fragments, all four transform arms) is the fp16 path unchanged.
* `kPackedScaleOn = (Scale_TileK == 8)` — per **unit**, not per binary, because the splitk bench compiles 11 shapes into
  one binary and a `static_assert` there fails the whole build. At gs=32 that is `TileK == 256`, which is also the
  one-superblock-per-k-tile condition, so one test covers both.
* `PPU_PACKED_SCALE_NOP=1` is a **timing-only** ablation: the decode returns constants, so results are deliberately wrong.

New/changed files worth knowing:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `actlize/include/cutlass/gguf_packed_scale.h` | the 16 B unit's bit map and decode: `PackBits`, `bit_of`, `code_of`, `code_from_words<Bit>`, `put_code`, `int_to_half_small`, `head_of_words`, `group_of_words<G,ScaleBias,HasMin,ZMul>`.

## 6. How to run everything

```bash
cd .../Kernels/general/w4a16_gemm/cutlass_w4a16
EX=.../build_ppu/examples/99_quactlize_w4a16_compare
```

**build.sh `rm -rf`s the same build dir every time**, so build a target and run it **immediately** — the previous
binary is gone. `PPU_DEFS` is space-separated and build.sh prints `PPU_DEFS verified on <target>'s compile command`;
if that line is missing the macro is NOT in the binary and any A/B is a binary compared with itself.

```bash

# acu, ONE config, both sides. SPLITK_ONLY is the WRONG knob: it matches the whole tag as a substring, so
# "16x128:256" selects every warp shape, every Stages and every slice count -- ~228 rows, one cold launch each,
# and the two reports then hold different kernel sets in different order. moe_splitk_bench_common.hpp:70-73
# documents the fix and I handed out the knob it warns about. SPLITK_CFG matches the config half (whitespace-safe),
# SPLITK_S matches the slice count exactly.
#   step 1 -- prove the selection is ONE row, WITHOUT acu. Exactly one "[acu] ONE COLD launch" line must print,

# THE FINGERPRINT IS grid x block, not the tag: this row is (8,16,1)x(256,1,1) -- grid.y = N/TN = 16, 8 warps,
# grid.z = slices = 1. A capture showing (8,32,4)x(128,1,1) is TN=64 at S=4: 1024 CTAs instead of 128 and 4 slices
# instead of 1, so EVERY per-CTA and per-store count in it is 8x-32x the baseline's for reasons that have nothing
# to do with the scale channel.
```

**Expected values for the pinned row, both sides.** These are what make a pinned capture readable, and each equality
was checked against the baseline capture before being written here -- they are a criterion, not a model:

| quantity | value | derivation |
|---|---|---|
| grid x block | `(8,16,1)x(256,1,1)` | 8 active experts (batch 1, top-k 8) x N/TN = 16 x slices = 1; 8 warps |
| `v.mma.f32.f16.m16n16k16` | **131,072** | 128 CTA x 8 warps x K/16 = 128 mma per warp |
| `vmem.st` | **512** | 16,384 halfs / 32 halfs per warp store |
| bytes written | **32,768** | total(8) x N(2048) x 2 -- REAL rows only; padded rows are not written |
| per-thread register demand | identical | depends only on (WM,WN,TK) = (16,16,256): accum 8, A frag 128, B frag 128 |

That last row is the one quantity that IS comparable across the two mismatched captures, and it says the `Regs 116`
vs `102` difference is attributable to the build rather than the shape.

**A retracted reading of the mismatched pair.** Its `vmem.ld = 135,168` against a blank baseline column looked like
register spill. It is not attributable: local-memory traffic and the grouped GEMM's own per-CTA expert metadata (a
cumsum scan over L=64 plus ptr/stride) both scale with CTA count, and 135,168/1024 = 132 loads per CTA is the size of
that scan. `u[]` in `packed_decode_stage` was audited for the actual spill mechanism -- a runtime index into a
register array -- and every index in `code_from_words`/`group_of_words` is compile-time (`w = Bit >> 5` constexpr,
`u[0]` literal, `u[w+1]` constexpr), so that array does not spill. Two different kernels cannot answer this; only the
pinned pair can.

```bash

# local gates (no box)

```

## 7. Facts that are not obvious from the code and cost time to rediscover

* **`moe_grouped_ppu.cuh:352`**: `n % 256 == 0 && k % 256 == 0` selects the **interleaved** B layout. An N that is not a
  multiple of 256 hands an interleave-256 buffer to a column-major reader → deterministic garbage that is **invariant
  under the quant mode and the tile**. That invariance is the signature; it is upstream of the scale channel by
  definition. (Cost: three rounds looking at the scale channel.)
* **`scale_load_k` is a TILE index**, not a group index — `partition_S` leaves the last mode selecting which block of
  `Scale_TileK` groups a call loads.
* **`sS` means two different layouts** in two functions: `partition_extra_inputs` builds it with `SmemLayoutScale`
  `(n, group, stage)`; `partition_extra_mma_info` with `SmemCopyLayoutScale` `(n, 1, stage*SK+g)`. Using the wrong one
  faults as `Exception TSM out of range` (a fault, not a wrong number — the good failure).
* **Q3_K's scale is `d*(sc6 − 32)`**, not `d*sc6`. It is the only non-zero `kScaleBias`; Q6_K's codes are signed int8.
* **`kSymBias2Plane = 1 << (W−1)`** — Q3_K 4, Q6_K 32 — is what lets a symmetric k-quant drop its zero channel entirely.
* **`ZMul = 8`** cancels the int4 converter's own −8. The alternative (converter `Bias = 0`) is accuracy-equivalent
  (0.0128 vs 0.0148 step against fp64 truth) but touches the shipped converter.
* **build.sh only descends into `_overlay_dirs=(gemv_lowbit)`** when overlaying sources, so a compiled header under
  `real_weight/` is absent at box build time while the local front-end check resolves it against the real tree and passes.
  Compiled headers live flat next to the harnesses.
* **`syntax_check.sh` compiles with `-DPPU_FORCE_INSTANTIATE=1`**, so it sees units the main `.cu` never builds — several
  errors only appear there. Record a **flag-on baseline** for each variant you care about; never baseline a `fatal error`.
* **Same-config run-to-run spread is ~13%.** A/B only within one run or back-to-back with identical filtering, and pin the
  config — the "winner" row can change config between runs.
* **`MOEG_SMEM=1` prints `GemmKernel::SharedStorageSize`**, but only for harnesses that go through
  `moe_grouped_ppu::filter_and_run` — and it cannot show a zero-tile saving in a **ScaleOnly** harness, because
  `elements_per_smem_zero()` is already 0 there.

## 8. The failure mode that produced most of the defects

**One relation, two derivations, only one of them checked.** Every significant bug this session was that shape:

* `PPU_A_CUBE_H` patched `DefaultGemm_AIU_Operand` while mixed-input builds its atom in `MixGemm_AIU_Operand` → inert;
* `Cvt2Plane` biased at the chunked site while the unchunked `Cvt2Plane::convert` did real arithmetic;
* the smem pitch as two literals (builder 16, collective 64) → `invalid VA`;
* `sS` (§7) and `scale_load_k` (§7) — and for `scale_load_k` the file **already contained the correct reading** in the k
  bound written a few lines above;
* the plan's own gate was wrong: it named `test_lowbit_grouped`, whose oracle is the same kernel at L=1 and is therefore
  structurally blind to a wrong dequant constant;
* B's nibble packing "corrected" against the convention validated three lines away in another harness.

What actually caught things: **grep every call site** rather than the one just edited; **name a shared quantity once** and
quote it; ask **what a number is invariant to** before reading it as arithmetic; and prefer a gate whose oracle is
*independent* of the kernel.

## 9. If you pick this up

**The open question is not "how do I make the decode cheaper".** It is **"where does the smem/traffic saving buy
occupancy"**, because in the decode band it demonstrably does not pay. Concretely:

1. Take the acu pair from §6 on `16x128:256` and check `smem/block` and measured `blocks/CU` first — F′ adds 4 KB/CTA
   and 4 blocks/CU means 16 KB, which could cross a threshold and alone explain 4–5 us. If it does, staging only needs
   **one** stage (the decode runs right after the wait), which is a small change.
2. Then measure where smem is the binding constraint: **gs=16 dense** (the scale tile is 12 KB at TN=128/TK=128/s3) and
   prefill shapes, with `MOEG_SMEM=1` reporting the delta. Report the smem delta explicitly — if occupancy moves, that is
   the mechanism; if it does not, the traffic saving is real but invisible there.
3. Q3_K/Q6_K are the better candidates for the whole idea than Q4_K: they have **no min channel at all** after plan #20
   phase 1, so their packed form is one int8 plus `d` and the zero tile is gone rather than merely re-formed.
4. Still owed: `unpack_q6k_expert` in `dump_real_weights.py` (there is none), so Q6_K's `−32` centre has never been
   checked against real Q6_K weights — only against the format definition and a synthetic golden I wrote.

## 10. The option this work did not price: a SEPARATE conversion kernel

Asked at the end of the session, and it reframes everything above. Note first that **the baseline already is "another
kernel"** — the conversion exists, it just runs on the host at fixture-build time. Moving it to a device kernel that runs
**once at load time** gets the gguf-native *ingestion* (read the mmapped native bytes directly, no host pre-multiplication
step, compatible with llama.cpp's loader) at **zero runtime cost**, because the GEMM then sees the untouched fp16 planes.

What it gives up is exactly what motivated the in-GEMM decode: device memory. Per 256 weights of Q4_K:

| form | bytes / 256 weights | vs native | in-GEMM decode cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| native (q 128 + d/dmin/scales 16) | **144** | — | measured **+20%** on the decode band (20.2 -> 24.2) |
| **int8 sc/mn + fp16 d/dmin** | **148** | **+2.8%** | codes are BYTE-addressable: no 6-bit extraction, no word straddle, ~4-5 instructions per pair instead of ~11 |
| fp16 planes, pre-multiplied (baseline) | **160** | +11% | 0 |

So keeping the native form saves **11%** of weight bytes and costs +20% of this band's GEMM time. On a 4.4 GB Q4_K_M
model that 11% is ~480 MB. Which side wins is a deployment question, not a kernel question — but it should be decided with
both numbers in view, which it was not when this work started.

**The middle point deserves a second look.** `int8 sc/mn + fp16 d/dmin` is exactly what `dump_packed_scale.py` already
emits (`RWMOEP`), and it was rejected early in this session *for widening the codes* — judged against native's 144. Its
real competitor is the 160 that production actually uses, and against that it is a 7.5% memory **saving** with an in-GEMM
decode several times cheaper than the 6-bit one, because most of those ~11 instructions per pair were bit extraction and
straddle handling that byte-aligned codes do not need.

Pieces that already exist for either route: `packed_decode_stage`'s body is the conversion kernel almost verbatim,
`rwmoep_loader.hpp` reads the fixture, `dump_packed_scale.py` emits the int8+d form, and `test_q4k_native_scale.cu` is
already a device-side decode-vs-host-reference gate — i.e. a standalone conversion kernel would inherit its test.
