# Gate for the MoE sweep unit GENERATOR. It SLICES ../CMakeLists.txt at run time rather than holding a copy, because the
# copy went stale within an hour: the committed .cmake still had the old dispatcher shape and reported OK while the real
# generator had moved on to per-format Best slots. A gate that can disagree with the thing it gates is not a gate.
#
# WHY IT MUST BE CMAKE. The bug it was written for could only be caught by CMake: `;` IS the list separator, so a WarpN
# list written "32;64" inside a row does not stay inside it -- foreach(IN LISTS) splits the row and the stray fragment has
# one field. A python mirror of the same table cannot see this (python's split(';') has no such semantics); the mirror
# validated the enumeration and passed while the real configure died with six "list index out of range" errors per row.
# The generator also printed "128 generated units" while broken, because 8 malformed iterations x 16 equals the 5 correct
# formats x 16 -- so the count that exists to catch a shrunken enumeration agreed with the right answer for the wrong
# reason.
#
#   ./gen_moe_units_check.sh                 assert the generator is sane (expectations are DERIVED from the axis lists)
#   BAD=1 ./gen_moe_units_check.sh           negative control: put a ';' back, must FATAL
#
# The negative control gets its OWN output directory. The script starts with REMOVE_RECURSE, so running the broken variant
# into the shared dir wipes the good tree and dies partway, and the wreckage reads exactly like a real failure -- I
# diagnosed "q6 is missing WarpN=64" from the corpse of my own negative control once.
