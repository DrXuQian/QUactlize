// int1 tile sweep + a diagnostic that separates where the ScaleZero cost actually comes from.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE FILE. test_fold_int2.cu is the verified correctness harness; a sweep needs many extra kernel
// instantiations and would slow its build for everyone. Nothing here is on the correctness path.
//
// WHAT THE SWEEP FOUND (20 configs, 42.0% -> 50.2%), and it took three attempts to state it correctly. Two
// INDEPENDENT factors, measured over 25 points across all three widths (this sweep plus the int4/int2/int1 ladders in
// test_width_acu) -- full derivation in fold_traits.hpp and fold_derivation/README.md:
//
//                        cvt/mma = 4              cvt/mma = 8
//     warps/CU >= 32     mean 52.1%  n=6          mean 39.1%  n=6     (-13.0)
//     warps/CU <= 16     mean 46.1%  n=16         mean 32.0%  n=2     (-20.1)
//                             (-6.0)
//
//   cvt/mma = 128/WM   converter amortisation. Separates with NO overlap in either row: a real ~13-point cliff.
//   warps/CU           occupancy, and it MUST include the register limit -- acu showed shared memory allowing 10
//                      blocks where registers allowed 4, and registers are billed rounded up to a POWER OF TWO, so
//                      129 costs as much as 256. Overlaps at cvt/mma=4, so ~6 points of mean shift, not a cliff.
//
// The two earlier stories looked contradictory because each varied only one axis: this sweep's high-warp configs are
// all WM=16 (cvt/mma=8), so warps/CU appeared to HURT, while the ladder's are WM=32, so it appeared to HELP. The
// REFUTED w16x64 rows below are kept as the evidence for the cvt/mma axis, and the TEST amort=4 row as the evidence
// that pushing cvt/mma below 4 buys +0.3 points.
//
// THE WEIGHT BUFFER DEPENDS ON (Bits, TN, TK) ONLY -- it is WN-INVARIANT, verified byte-for-byte in
// fold_derivation/l20_derived_offline.cu at WN=32 and WN=64. So configs sharing a TK share a buffer, and the sweep
// regroups by TK instead of rebuilding per config. TK=64 is the exception: it needs the bit-granular packer, so it
// gets its own buffer from nfold_place_bits_int1_tk64.
//
// THE ZERO DIAGNOSTIC (FOLD_ZDIAG=1), and its ANSWER -- which was not one of the two options it offered. The split
// was "if the zero cost tracks gs it is the COPY (reloads = K/gs); if it is flat in gs it is the TRANSFORM
// (= K/16)". The cost does track gs (+49.5us at gs=32, +81.9us at gs=16 at TK=128) -- and then the stride-0 scale
// broadcast cut the reload's smem requests to a QUARTER and changed nothing at all: delta +49.50 vs +49.6 recorded,
// +81.94 vs +83.0. So a third quantity also tracks gs: the per-reload smem round-trip LATENCY, which depends on the
// NUMBER of reloads and not on how wide each one is. Consistent with the kernel being latency-bound at cvt/mma=4.
// The remedy is an EARLIER reload (prefetch the next group's scale), not a narrower one, and not the fused FMA
// either -- that attempt regressed 52.3% -> 33.5% by replacing a vectorized cute::transform with a scalar
// fp16->float->fp16 loop.
//
//   Build: TARGET=test_int1_sweep ./build.sh ; run: ./<bin> [N] [K] [gs]
//   FOLD_ZDIAG=1 adds the ScaleOnly/ScaleZero pairs at both group sizes.
