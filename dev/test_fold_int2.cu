// P1.3f: FIRST box run of the N-FOLD path -- single-plane int2 folded to TileShape.K=64 (FoldF=2, so the B operand's
// AIU contiguous run is 2*64=128 elements = 32B, reusing the VALIDATED int2@TK128 AiuContElemSize/swzl/converter).
//
// Why int2-fold@TK64 first (not the concat): it is the simplest possible fold, and its target geometry is exactly
// int4@TK64 which measures 55.8% MFU (gs=32) / 53.1% (gs=16) on this box, vs int2@TK128's 37.1% / 30.9%. So a working
// fold should move int2 from ~37% toward ~55%.
//
// Correctness: A=identity, scale=1, zero=0 => D[m][n] == the dequantized weight at (m,n), so a wrong fold shows up as
// a permutation/garbage immediately (same controlled-input trick that cracked the sigma_n and 2-plane bugs).

// THE ONE TABLE. Every (bits, tile, warp) this harness supports, written ONCE; the offline placement, the banner and
// the kernel launch are all generated from these rows.
//
// WHY A TABLE AND NOT THREE LADDERS. That is what was here before, and the three did not agree. The banner printed the
// raw FOLD_TM while the launch ladder collapsed everything that was not 32 down to 64, so `FOLD_TM=128` measured
// (64,...) under a banner that said 128; and the offline ladder was a third copy, duplicated verbatim between the main
// path and FOLD_DECODE's run_once. The file's own comments warn twice about "the same cross-config mismatch that
// invalidated the int1 MFU numbers" -- three independent derivations of one decision is how that keeps happening.
//
// MEMBERSHIP IS THE DELIVERY BOUND. A row exists iff `slots = WN*TK/32 >= delivery = 128/bits`. That REPLACES the
// `if constexpr` guard that used to sit inside CORR_DISPATCH: an over-delivering shape is not a shape the table has,
// so asking for one prints the table instead of silently dropping half the converted data (the 44.9%-random result).
// int1 at TK=64 therefore appears only at WN=64 -- which is precisely why it used to need its own packer.
