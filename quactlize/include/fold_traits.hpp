// FoldTraits: ONE place that derives every quantity the N-fold depends on, so the ones that are currently
// computed independently (swzl delivery size, mma fragment slots, converter emission, gmem address layout) can no
// longer disagree silently.
//
// READ THIS FIRST -- A RETRACTION. An earlier version of this header carried a "theorem" that a folded column
// could never be narrower than a half-run, hence TK*Bits >= 128, hence F <= 2, hence int1 could never run at
// TK=64. That was WRONG. The two measurements it rested on are sound (see fold_derivation/), but the inference
// was not: LEG 2 shows the four lanes of a lane/4 group demand the same SET of N, and I read it as the same
// SINGLE N. A thread demands many columns, so nothing forces one column per half-run.
//
// What actually kills int1 at TK=64 is the OFFLINE PACKER, and it is fixable. Per-thread demand vs delivery
// (leg5_perthread.cu, straight out of cute's partition_B):
//     int1 TN=128 TK=64 : thread wants 128 slots = 8 columns x 16 k ; swzl gives 4 words x 32 codes
//                         a column needs 16 k and a word holds 32 codes  =>  TWO columns must share each word
// nfold_regroup_gmem moves whole uint32 words (dst[dst_w] = src[src_w]), so it can only ever put ONE column in a
// word -- it supplies 4 of the 8 columns the thread needs. That is exactly the measured n_used = n % Ng. The fix
// is a bit-granular offline, not a bigger converter and not a larger TK. (int4 at F=1 already does a non-1:1
// word<->column mapping, in the other direction: a word holds 8 codes while a column needs 16 k.)
//
// The one constraint that survives is OVER-DELIVERY: a thread cannot use more codes than its fragment has slots,
// because the surplus is never fetched. That is what rules out int1 at TN=64/TK=64 (128 codes into 64 slots) and
// it is what CheckDelivery<> asserts. It also says a fold at a given TK needs a minimum TN.
//
// BOX REFERENCE POINTS (7 correct + 2 broken), with what each invariant says about them:
//   int4 (64, 64, 64)  F=1  deliv  32  slots  64   OK   55.9%
//   int2 (64, 64, 64)  F=2  deliv  64  slots  64   OK   53.2%
//   int2 (64,128, 64)  F=2  deliv  64  slots 128   OK   bad=0
//   int2 (64, 64,128)  F=1  deliv  64  slots 128   OK   original validated path
//   int1 (32,128,128)  F=2  deliv 128  slots 256   OK   bad=0 (MFU UNVERIFIED, see below)
//   int1 (64, 64,128)  F=2  deliv 128  slots 128   OK   bad=0 (MFU UNVERIFIED, see below)
//   int1 (64, 64,256)  F=1  deliv 128  slots 256   OK   original validated path
//   int1 (64, 64, 64)  F=4  deliv 128  slots  64   BAD  over-delivery -- genuinely impossible
//   int1 (64,128, 64)  F=4  deliv 128  slots 128   BAD  counting is FINE; the offline packer is what fails
// The last row is the one worth having in mind: nothing structural forbids it.
//
// CAUTION ON int1's RECORDED MFU. Every int1 throughput number on file (54.3% at gs=32, 45.3% at gs=16) came from
// a harness whose perf lambda hardcoded (64,128,64) while its correctness check ran the env-selected
// (32,128,128) -- bad=0 and the MFU came from DIFFERENT tiles. The CORRECTNESS results stand; the throughput
// numbers do not. Fixed in test_fold_int2.cu; the labels now carry the launched TileShape.

// bought anything, and it is why an earlier version of this file -- which used slots = 8*(TN/32)*(TK/16) -- was
// wrong. That form is right only when TN == 2*WN, and at TN=128/WN=32 it over-estimated slots 2x and would have
// PASSED int1 (64,128,64), a configuration measured broken on the box.
//
// Over-delivery alone separates all nine reference points, 9/9. Written out, the condition is
//     WN * TK * Bits >= 4096
// which at the WM=WN=32 every fold test passes reduces to TK*Bits >= 128 -- int1 >= 128, int2 >= 64, int4 >= 32.
//
// THE ESCAPE, and it is real: slots scales with WN. At WN=64 int1 at TK=64 has slots == delivery == 128 and is
// feasible. But raising WN also raises how many logical columns must share one 32-bit word,
//     cols_per_word = WN / 32
// (also measured, same file) -- so WN=64 needs a packer that interleaves TWO columns inside a word, which
// nfold_regroup_gmem's whole-uint32 moves cannot express. The two constraints pincer int1 at TK=64: WN must rise
// to fix delivery, and raising WN forces the packer upgrade. Both, or neither.

// choice will otherwise instantiate illegal ones and trip the static_assert -- which is what happened on the box
// with int1 at TK=64 from CORR_DISPATCH(64,64,64). Gate and guard must be the SAME expression or they drift.

// the collective builder returns `int`, which surfaces as "CollectiveEpilogue (aka int) cannot be used prior to ::"
// deep inside gemm_universal_adapter.h. Pure arithmetic, so it is checkable without instantiating anything -- which
// matters because the local front-end gate CANNOT see this class: the stub environment's own errors abort template

//     rung 4  Regs=186  128 thr/blk  Block Limit Registers 4    theoretical 16 warp/CU  achieved 15.2
// and it says so outright: "theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the number of required registers", with
// shared memory allowing 10 blocks where registers allow 4.
//
// REGISTERS ARE BILLED ROUNDED UP TO A POWER OF TWO. Reverse it from acu's own warp counts: 131072/32 warps =
// 128 reg/thread for a kernel reporting 112, and 131072/16 = 256 for one reporting 186. So 112 is billed as 128
// and 186 as 256 -- 129 registers cost exactly as much as 256. That cliff, not the raw count, is what matters,
// and it is why regs=176 and regs=104 behave like different animals while 176 vs 240 do not.
// ESTIMATE-TO-MEASURED OFFSET. regs_per_thread is consistently ~22 BELOW what acu reports, at both points measured:
//     estimate 176 -> acu 186        estimate 128 -> acu 142     (int1, (32,128,64) w32x64, unchunked / B-chunked)
// so ~10 and ~14; 12 splits them. IT DOES NOT EXTRAPOLATE RELIABLY: the chunked sweep gained +10.2 points at
// (32,128,128) w32x32, which only makes sense if that config crossed into the 128 bucket, yet 120 + 12 = 132 says it
// did not. Two anchor points cannot call a boundary. Treat the model as ordering configs, not as deciding buckets --
// only acu on the specific config does that.
// The gap is address arithmetic, pipeline temporaries and the packed source registers -- things the model does not
// count. It lives here rather than in a comment somewhere because every billing decision compares against 128 or 256,
// so the estimate is useless without it: 120 looks like it clears 128 and does not.
//
// THIRD ANCHOR, AND IT BREAKS THE OFFSET FOR CHUNKED CONFIGS (acu, 2026-07-27, the shipping best config
// (64,128,64) w64x64 s2 gs=32 ScaleOnly int1 with PPU_B_CHUNK=1): acu reports **140 regs**, grid (64,32,1)x(64,1,1),

//
// The cvt/mma axis separates with NO overlap in either row -- it is a genuine cliff, ~13 points. The warps/CU axis
// OVERLAPS at cvt/mma=4 (47.8-50.2 appears in both cells), so it is a mean shift of ~6-7 points, not a cliff. The
// two are roughly additive.
//
// WHY THE EARLIER STORIES LOOKED CONTRADICTORY. The int1 sweep's high-warp configs were all WM=16 (cvt/mma=8), so
// raising warps/CU appeared to HURT; the ladder's high-warp configs were WM=32 (cvt/mma=4), so raising warps/CU
// appeared to HELP. Same quantity, opposite apparent sign, because each experiment moved the other factor too.
//
// PRESCRIPTION: cvt/mma = 4 (WM >= 32) AND warps/CU >= 32. The second needs registers billed at <= 128, which at
// TK=64 means WN=32 -- and the delivery bound forbids that for int1. That is int1's ceiling, stated in the two
// quantities that actually govern it.

// CONVERTER AMORTISATION -- the objective, and it is NOT the register count.
//
// A PRESCRIPTION DERIVED FROM regs_per_thread ALONE FAILED ON THE BOX. accum = WM*WN/32 depends only on the warp
// shape and the delivery bound constrains only WN, so w16x64 keeps int1's TK=64 legal while halving the
// accumulator: 128 estimated regs against 176. Measured 39.7% against 50.0%. Fewer registers, comparable
// occupancy, 10.3 points worse.
//
// What separates all 20 measured points, with no overlap, is WM:
//     WM=32, regs<=256 : 40.9 - 50.2%   (10 points)
//     WM=16, regs<=256 : 31.9 - 39.8%   ( 8 points)
// and the best WM=16 point has blk=32, the HIGHEST occupancy in the sweep, while the worst WM=32 point has blk=4,
// the lowest -- so `blocks` orders WITHIN a group but cannot cross between them.
//
// THE MECHANISM (counted from cute in fold_derivation/l26_convert_amort.cu, not argued). In a mixed-input GEMM
// every B fragment element must be converted (lop3 + fma) and scaled before it can enter an mma. Per thread per
// k-tile:
//     mma instructions  = (WM/16)*(WN/16)*(TK/16)
//     B elems to cvt    = 8*(WN/16)*(TK/16)
//     cvt elems per mma = 128/WM                    <- WN and TK cancel EXACTLY; only WM survives
// Each B fragment feeds WM/16 mma instructions down the M direction, so WM/16 is the amortisation factor. WM=16
// means every converted element feeds exactly one mma and the converter cost per unit of math doubles. This is the
// quantised-B analogue of arithmetic intensity, at the register file rather than at HBM -- and it is why a
// prescription that bought registers by cutting WM was exactly backwards.
//
// cvt/mma IS A THRESHOLD, NOT A RATE -- and the register cliff is not at 256. Both corrections come from ONE
// measurement: w64x64, the only int1 shape that reaches cvt/mma=2, run against its cvt/mma=4 peer at EQUAL blk.
//     (64,128,64) w32x64 s2   cvt/mma=4  regs=176  blk=13  ->  48.4%
//     (64,128,64) w64x64 s2   cvt/mma=2  regs=272  blk=13  ->  48.7%
// Halving the converter work AND spending 96 extra registers nets +0.3 points. So:
//
//   (a) cvt/mma=8 is throughput-bound on the B convert path, and cvt/mma<=4 is not. The signature is occupancy
//       sensitivity, measured over the same ~5x blk span at regs<=176, TK<=128:
//           cvt/mma=8 : blk  8 -> 32   MFU 38.4 - 39.8%   spread 1.4 points   FLAT -- more blocks do nothing
//           cvt/mma=4 : blk  4 -> 23   MFU 40.8 - 50.2%   spread 9.4 points   blocks ARE the lever
//       A flat response to 4x the occupancy is what a throughput ceiling looks like. Once past it, cutting cvt/mma
//       further buys nothing, which is why WM=64 gains +0.3 and not another 10 points.
//
//   (b) the register penalty is GRADED and its knee is above 272, not at 256. Against a same-blk 176-reg peer:
//           272 regs -> +0.3 points (nothing)      288 regs -> -2.6      320 regs -> -19.9
//       So 256 was a guess that happened to sit below the real knee. Treat >288 as the danger zone.
//
// THE PRESCRIPTION, and int1's measured optimum is exactly it: get cvt/mma to 4 (WM >= 32), stay under ~288 regs,
// then maximise blocks -> w32x64 s2 at TK=64.
//
// RETRACTED: "int1 is capped at amort=2, and int4 (64,64,32) w64x32 is an untried lever." The cap is real (WM=64
// needs 272 regs at every shape legal under WN*TK >= 4096; asserted in ft_check) but it is HARMLESS, because
// cvt/mma=2 is worth +0.3 points. int4's production config is already at cvt/mma=4, so pushing it to 2 has nothing
// to gain either -- do not spend a box run on it.
