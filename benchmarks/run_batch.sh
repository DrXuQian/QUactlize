# ONE RUN FOR EVERY OPEN QUESTION. Six binaries, built once, kept, then measured on one pinned configuration.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A COMMAND BLOCK. Every trap this task has hit is a step that is easy to drop by hand:
#   * build.sh `rm -rf`s the SAME output directory, so a binary must be copied out BEFORE the next build starts;
#     forget it and you compare a binary with itself, which is indistinguishable from "the change does nothing"
#   * a macro that never reached the device compile produces the same "no change"; build.sh prints
#     "PPU_DEFS verified on <target>'s compile command" and this script FAILS if that line is missing
#   * SPLITK_ONLY matches the whole tag, so "16x128:256" keeps every warp shape, every Stages and every slice count --
#     ~228 rows, one cold launch each. SPLITK_CFG + SPLITK_S pin exactly one
#   * same-config run-to-run spread is ~13%, so every number here comes from ONE run of ONE binary set
#
#   ./run_batch.sh build     build all six and copy them out (slow: ~6 compiles)
#   ./run_batch.sh check     correctness gates -- must pass before any timing is meaningful
#   ./run_batch.sh perf      the pinned rows
#   ./run_batch.sh           all three, in that order
# pipefail, because do_check pipes each executable through grep and tail: without it the pipeline reports the
# status of `tail`, the harness's own exit code is discarded, and a MISMATCH or a crash still lets `all`
# proceed to timing. The whole point of running the gates before the timings is that nothing below them
# means anything if they fail.

   swz     - base           the scale read's bank conflicts, 4-way -> 1-way (l98). Attacks the 6.6% that
                            PPU_SCALE_PREFETCH could not: SK_QUANT=0 prices the whole reload at 7.3% and
                            prefetch, which removes only the WAITING, recovered 0.7%
   base    - bdqnop         what the BASELINE int4->fp16 dequant costs. Upper bound: the ablation also drops
                            most of the scale/zero LOADS, since only one fragment element stays live
   pack    - base           the native-format tax as it stands (+12.9% at last measurement)
   pack    - packnop        the packed decode's ARITHMETIC alone
   packnop - base           its transport, its explicit stores, and the barrier slot they sit in
   packsplit - pack         eight warps decoding four groups each instead of four decoding eight. Better means the
                            publication barrier's critical path costs; no change means aggregate issue demand does

   bdqnop and packnop produce DELIBERATELY WRONG numbers -- read their time, never their MATCH.
