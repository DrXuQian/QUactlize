// Shared harness for the MoE shape-band sweep. The sweep itself lives in one moe_bench_*.cu per format, NOT here.
//
// WHY SPLIT AT ALL. Every row of the sweep is a full kernel instantiation, and one .cu is ONE hgcc invocation, so a
// 200-row sweep in a single translation unit compiles strictly serially. cutlass_build_dev_kernels emits one
// add_custom_command per .cu (cmake/PPUToolchain.cmake), so N sources become N independent commands and `make -j`
// runs them concurrently. Splitting is the only way to instantiate MORE and wait LESS -- the alternative,
// instantiating less, is not on the table.
//
// The split is by (format, WarpN) rather than by format alone so the largest unit stays near the size of the old
// single-file sweep: q3/q5 have one legal WarpN so they are one file each; q6/i2/i4 have two, so they are two.

//
// AND IT MUST BE A LOWER BOUND. The first version printed only the DMA-issued upper bound and reported 116-181% of
// HBM, which answers nothing: a bound looser than the hardware peak is not a measurement. The over-count is A --
// 60% of the total on the worst row -- because `mt * (N/TN) * TM * K * 2` assumes every n-tile column re-reads all of
// A from DRAM, when the CTAs sharing an m-tile read the IDENTICAL A tile (128 KB at TM=32) and will hit L2.
//
//   floor  every byte crosses the bus AT LEAST once:  A = total_rows*K*2, B+S once per ACTIVE expert, D = rows*N*2
//   ceil   the DMA-issued bound above
//   noreuse = ceil/floor -- how much reuse the L2 must be supplying. A ratio, deliberately not a percentage.
//
// WHICH END IS CONCLUSIVE, and I had this BACKWARDS in the first version of this comment and in three messages built on it.
// Achieved traffic lies in [floor, ceil], so achieved bandwidth lies in [floor/t, ceil/t]:
//   * ceil/t  < peak  =>  DEFINITELY NOT saturated. CONCLUSIVE, and it is the ceiling that gives it.
//   * floor/t ~ peak  =>  DEFINITELY saturated. CONCLUSIVE the other way.
//   * a LOW floor/t says NOTHING -- the truth may sit at the ceiling. That is the error: "low floor means not
//     bandwidth-bound" is false, because the lower bound being small does not bound the actual from above.
// Both ends are printed now. And the strongest argument needs neither: if two configs of the same format differ by 1.4-2.8x
// in ceiling traffic and land within 0.4-6% in TIME, traffic is not the limiter -- that is what the decode run showed.
// OCCUPANCY IS PRINTED, not inferred. The decode measurement showed 256 CTAs and 128 CTAs of the same format landing within
// 0.4% of each other -- both fit in one wave, so the time is ONE CTA's K-loop latency and adding CTAs cannot touch it. What
// can is the number of tile loads in flight, which per CTA is exactly `Stages`, and per CU is `blocks/CU * Stages`. That
// quantity was never on screen, so the hypothesis could only be argued.
//
// `blk` COMES FROM fold::warps_per_cu_chunked, NOT from a formula written here. The first version of this used
// `min(262144/smem, 64/warps)` -- which fold_traits.hpp and the README both record as KNOWN-WRONG: acu said outright
// "theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the number of required registers", shared memory allowing 10 blocks where
// registers allowed 4, and that missing register term is why an earlier `blk` "kept failing to order the data". The correct
// model bills registers ROUNDED UP TO A POWER OF TWO (129 costs exactly what 256 costs) and is pinned by static_assert to
// acu's measured points. Re-deriving it here would have been the same mistake a second time.
// `wav` uses CU = 72, which acu confirmed independently through its own wave arithmetic (1024 - 3*288 = 160).
//
// AND `ifl` IS INVARIANT IN Stages WHENEVER smem BINDS, which it does at every decode shape here (blk_smem 19 < blk_warp 32
// for i4 (32,64,32) w32x32). Since blk = 256KB / (smem_per_stage * Stages), the product blk*Stages collapses to
// 256KB / smem_per_stage: i4 (32,64,32) gives ifl 76 at s4 and 72 at s12 -- deepening the pipeline does not add in-flight
// loads, it CONCENTRATES the same total into fewer CTAs and costs warps. So "more stages" and "more occupancy" pull opposite
// ways here, and the lever that actually raises the total is SHRINKING smem per stage: TileN=32 halves both the B and the
// scale term (3328 -> 2688 B, ifl <= 97). Dropping the zero tile (#20 Phase 1) is only 128 B of 3328, i.e. 3.8%.

// rather than a list someone maintains. The five points it used to enumerate were missing (128,32) and (256,32).)

// STAGES IS AN AXIS, and it was not one. It was baked into each hand-written row, which left int4's single-plane
// winner at s3 and int2's IDENTICAL shape at s2 -- so `i4 382.76 vs i2 420.83` was not a format comparison, it was s3
// vs s2. On dense the same tile moved 1.46x between s2 and s3. 4 is included because it is the toolchain's default
// and therefore the value someone gets by accident.
// DEEPER THAN 4, because `Stages` IS the per-CTA count of tile loads in flight and the decode band is latency-bound with a
// tiny tile: i4 (32,64,32) is ~3.25 KB/stage, so s16 costs 52 KB of the 256 KB budget. The collective caps nothing above
// `Stages >= 2`; smem does, and moe_ok's smem predicate filters the rest, so these cost nothing on the prefill shapes where
// A-smem is 8-32 KB/stage and they simply do not fit.
// MOE_STAGES narrows this axis from the build, for the same reason the tile lists can be narrowed: the cost is entirely
// front-end template instantiation at ~3.0 s per kernel, so halving the stage list halves the per-unit time.
