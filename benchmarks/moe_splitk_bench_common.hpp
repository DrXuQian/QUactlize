// Shared harness for the grouped split-K bench. The config rows live in one generated .cu each, NOT here --
// every row instantiates the AIU mixed-input collective, and on the box the expensive stages are LLVM opt/llc,
// single-threaded and minutes per kernel. Five rows in one translation unit is five of those in series.
//
// Grouped mixed-input GEMM at splitk=1 and splitk>1, on the REAL grouped shape.
//
// This produces two of the three winners to profile; the third (the CUDA-core GEMV) comes from
// test_gemv_perf.cu. They are reported the same way on purpose.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The split-K question was first put to a DENSE ladder at m=8, where TileM=16 gives mt=1 and
// the launch is 64 CTAs on a 72-CU part (acu: DRAM 4.43%). That measurement could not answer anything, and
// no dense shape can: matching grouped's grid needs mt=8, but a dense m=128 shares ONE B across its 8 m-tiles
// while grouped's 8 experts have 8 different B's that cannot be shared. So the question only has an answer on
// the grouped path.
//
// WHAT SPLIT-K CAN AND CANNOT BUY, stated up front so the numbers are read against a prediction. Decode today
// is 512 CTAs x 64 threads = 1024 warps = 14.2 warps/CU with acu measuring 13.65 achieved -- every warp of the
// launch resident at once, no second wave, so occupancy is bounded by WORK and not by smem or registers.
// Split-K multiplies the CTA count by S, so it buys resident warps up to the theoretical ceiling acu reported
// (18 warps/CU, 28.13%) and no further: about 1.27x. It also multiplies A and scale traffic by S while leaving
// weight traffic alone, and adds the partial buffer plus the merge pass. If the measured speedup exceeds
// 1.27x, the occupancy model is what was wrong.
//
// Build: TARGET=test_moe_splitk_bench ./build.sh
